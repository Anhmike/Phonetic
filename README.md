<h1>Phonetic.me</h1>
<p>This is a tool to transcribe English text into their phonetic equivalent. All the existing websites that do this are hideous and not user friendly. I'm currently taking an intro linguistics course and thought I'd make some useful tools for my classmates to use.</p>
<p>You can view the project at phonetic.me</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try phoneticme.herokuapp.com</p>
